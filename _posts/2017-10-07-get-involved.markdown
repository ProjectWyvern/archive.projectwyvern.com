Project Wyvern is a community-driven effort; we're always excited to join forces with new contributors.

### Service Providers

Run an exchange? Interested in starting a Wyvern pool? Want to support Wyvern in your wallet application?

Wyvern follows the standard Bitcoin RPC API and is easy to integrate. If you require any assistance, [contact us][contactus]. Once you've finished your integration, let us know and we'll list you under [Service Providers][serviceproviders].

### Wyvern Exchange

Currently under development, the Wyvern Exchange will allow users to buy and sell virtual merchandise peer-to-peer using Wyvern. We're particularly on the lookout for designers and frontend developers - if you might be interested, [get in touch][contactus] and send over a brief portfolio demonstrating past work.
